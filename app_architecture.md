# Resona Model Application Architecture

## Overview
The Resona Model Application is a Python-based tool that implements the advanced voice analysis, reproduction, and incubation methodologies developed in the Resona Model research. The application provides a modern, responsive UI inspired by ShadCN design principles and guides users through complex workflows while maintaining usability.

## Core Components

### 1. Application Structure
- **Frontend**: Flask-based web application with Tailwind CSS and custom ShadCN-inspired components
- **Backend**: Python API handlers for processing inputs and interfacing with AI services
- **Data Management**: Local storage for session data and analysis results
- **AI Integration**: Flexible API client for connecting to various AI providers

### 2. User Interface Design
- **Design System**: ShadCN-inspired components including:
  - Dark mode with accent colors
  - Card-based layouts
  - Subtle animations and transitions
  - Responsive design for all device sizes
  - Accessible form controls
- **Navigation**: Tab-based navigation between modes and step-based progression within workflows
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear visual distinction between input areas, guidance text, and results

### 3. Mode-Specific Workflows

#### Master Analysis Mode
- **Onboarding**: Introduction to analysis capabilities and input requirements
- **Input Collection**: 
  - Text transcript upload/input
  - Audio file upload (optional)
  - Context information input
  - Analysis objectives specification
- **Processing**: AI API integration for deep analysis
- **Results Presentation**: 
  - Hierarchical display of analysis results
  - Expandable sections for detailed insights
  - Visual representations of key patterns
  - Exportable reports

#### Reproduction Mode
- **Onboarding**: Introduction to reproduction capabilities
- **Input Collection**:
  - Previous analysis results import or manual characteristic input
  - Target content type specification
  - Audience and context information
  - Purpose of communication
  - Special requirements or constraints
- **Processing**: AI API integration for voice reproduction
- **Results Presentation**:
  - Generated content display
  - Side-by-side comparison with source voice
  - Editable output with guidance
  - Export options for different formats

#### Incubation Mode
- **Onboarding**: Introduction to new voice creation process
- **Input Collection**: Structured form with six main categories:
  - Entity Foundation Inputs
  - Stakeholder Value Alignment
  - Psychological Positioning Inputs
  - Archetypal Foundation Inputs
  - Linguistic Style Preferences
  - Emotional Expression Parameters
- **Processing**: AI API integration for voice synthesis
- **Results Presentation**:
  - New voice profile display
  - Sample content in the new voice
  - Refinement options
  - Export of voice guidelines

### 4. Technical Architecture

#### Frontend Layer
- **Web Framework**: Flask for routing and template rendering
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS with custom components
- **JavaScript**: Minimal JS for enhanced interactions and form validation
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with adaptive layouts

#### Application Layer
- **Mode Controllers**: Separate controllers for each workflow mode
- **Form Processors**: Validation and processing of complex form inputs
- **Session Management**: Secure handling of user sessions and data
- **Export Utilities**: PDF, Markdown, and plain text export capabilities

#### AI Integration Layer
- **API Client**: Flexible client supporting multiple AI providers
- **Prompt Engineering**: Dynamic construction of prompts based on user inputs
- **Response Processing**: Parsing and structuring of AI responses
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of API failures and rate limits

#### Data Management Layer
- **Session Storage**: Temporary storage of analysis in progress
- **Result Storage**: Persistent storage of completed analyses
- **Export Management**: Formatting and delivery of exportable results
